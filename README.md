# IoT assignment #1 (design by [Reza Serati](https://github.com/Reza-Serati))
The purpose of this exercise is to examine the functions and capabilities of the IoT node. In this exercise, we use the NodeMCU board as one of the IoT nodes. The NodeMCU board is an open-source hardware platform suitable for IoT projects that require wireless connectivity.
To do this exercise, you will need a NodeMCU board, an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), and a Water Sensor Module.

# IoT assignment #2 ([Nazanin Akhtarian](https://github.com/nazanin97))
This exercise consists of two parts; In the first part you will get acquainted with the WiFi capabilities of the NodeMCU board and in the second part you will get acquainted with the RFID-RC522 module.

# IoT assignment and present LoRaWAN section #3 ([jaber babaki](https://github.com/JaberBabaki))
LoRaWAN Network As one of the most important LPWAN networks is emerging as a long-range network infrastructure for a large number of Internet of Thing devices. In this presentation, we explore the concepts of the LoRaWAN network and explain two important layers LoRaWAN network: LoRa and LoRaWAN. In the following, we will review the related work to the Laura network. [Technical overview LoRaWAN network](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355475370_Technical_overview_LoRaWAN_network)

# IoT assignment #4 (Ali Shafiee)
The ultimate goal of this exercise is to implement a part of a smart home (smart bathtub) by the mentioned protocols. In the implementation of this smart bathtub, each person's information (including the level of water and the desired water temperature) is personalized and stored in a database. This automatic personalization is not only used for the convenience of the residents but also saves water consumption as well as time for these people. You will use two protocols, MQTT and CoAP, to implement this scenario.

# IoT assignment #5 (design by jaber babaki)
The purpose of this exercise is to get acquainted with the operation of the IoT platform. In previous exercises, we were introduced to the basic concepts of the Internet, and we know that, in simple terms, the Internet of Things is the connection of sensors and devices to a network through which they can interact with each other and with their users. Allows the user to remotely control these objects across the network infrastructure. The IoT platform is a multi-layered technology that enables the management and automation of connected devices in the IoT world. In simpler terms, the purpose of any IoT device is to connect to other devices and applications through IoT protocols, and therefore IoT platforms are used to bridge the gap between sensors and IoT devices. These platforms connect the sensors to the network and then use the information collected by the sensors using applications and send the necessary commands to the operators by the collected information.
